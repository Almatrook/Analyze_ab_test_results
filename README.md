<!-- Overview -->
## Overview
A/B test is most commonly conducted by data analysts to prioritize what to do in the future.

The purpose of this project to apply an A/B testing by a company e-commerce website in regard to help promote their decision whether holding the old page or go forward to the new page transformation.

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.



<!-- Detail -->
## Details
A statistically significant result has been measured on a dataset by doing measure P values, confidence intervals.

## Findings
The most important findings are:

In A/B test, findings show that the p-value is 0.896 which is greater than type I error with Î± = 0.05, and the z-score is 1.2616 which is less than the critical z-score 1.9599. Therefore, the test fail to reject the null hypothesis which indicate that holding in the old page is equal or better than to convert to the new page.

In regression model for conversion based on which page a customer receives, there is a dependency relationship with them but with very small p-value this relation is unlikely to be significant statistically.

In regression model for conversion based on which country a user lives, the p-value associated with ab_page is 0.191 which means the relationship to conversion and these variables values mentioned in the last section is not statistically significant.

As a result, there is no evidence proved that the new page has a better conversion rate than the old page.
